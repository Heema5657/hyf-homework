                <h3>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h3>
                     <p>Since the comercialization of the web, web development has been a growing industry. The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their website to sell products and services to customers.[1]</p>
                    <p>There is an open software for web development like BerkeleyDB, GlassFish, LAMP(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. This has kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum. Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been the rise of easy-to-use WYSIWYG web-development software, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Visual Studio. Knowledge of HyperTextMarkup Language(HTML) or of programming languages is still required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly with the help of help files, technical books, internet tutorials or face-to-face training.</p>
                    <p>An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have halped developers build more dynamic and active websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications as web services which were traditionally only available as applications on a desk-based computer. This has allowed for many opportuinities to decentralize information and media distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox and GoogleDocs. These web services allows users to interact with application from many locations, instead of being tied to a specific workstation for their application environment.</p>
